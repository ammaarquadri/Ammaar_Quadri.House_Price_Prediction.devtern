## Task 1: House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Predicting house prices is a fundamental challenge in real estate and finance. This repository guides you through building a machine learning model for house price prediction using the House Price Prediction Dataset. We cover data preparation, visualization, feature analysis, model building, and evaluation to achieve accurate predictions.

### Task Overview

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict house prices using the House Price Prediction Dataset.

### Dataset

You can access the House Price Prediction Dataset [here](link_to_dataset).

### Task Execution

1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Data Loading:** Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for efficient manipulation and exploration.
   - **Data Visualization:** Utilize visualization libraries like Matplotlib to gain insights into feature distributions and identify patterns.

2. **Feature Analysis**
   - **Correlation Analysis:** Use tools like Seaborn to explore correlations between features and the target variable (house prices).

3. **Building the Machine Learning Model**
   - Develop and train a machine learning model optimized for predicting house prices.

### Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning

After building the initial model:
- Evaluate its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters or trying different algorithms if necessary.

This project provides a comprehensive guide to leveraging machine learning for accurate house price predictions.
